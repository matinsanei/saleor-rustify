# Saleor parity — master checklist (measured 2026-09-25)

Schema baseline: `saleor-dashboard-3.23.33/schema-main.graphql` = **90 queries / 339 mutations**.
Ours (live SDL): **91 queries / 346 mutations** (extra = legacy aliases like
`orderAddNote`, old-style `createCheckout`, `_nodeAnchor`).
Every schema root resolves live — zero "Unknown field/argument" gaps.
Dashboard ops: **458/458 green**. DB contracts: **175/175 green**.

Legend: `[x]` real + tested · `[~]` real but bounded (documented) · `[ ]` missing/stub.

## 1. Checkout (storefront + legacy names)
- [x] New API: `checkoutCreate/LinesAdd/LinesUpdate/LineDelete/Delete/EmailUpdate/CustomerAttach/Detach/NoteUpdate/Shipping/BillingAddress/Shipping/DeliveryMethod/LanguageCode/Add/RemovePromoCode`
- [x] `checkoutPaymentCreate` (legacy gateway payment row), `checkoutCreateFromOrder` (unavailable-variants reported), `checkoutLinesDelete`, `deliveryOptionsCalculate` (shipping methods + pickup warehouses)
- [x] Old-style equivalents (`createCheckout`, `checkoutAddLines`, `checkoutComplete`…)

## 2. Transactions / payments (real money movement)
- [x] `transactionUpdate` (Django delta/adjustment semantics incl. psp-less cutoff fix), `transactionEventReport` (idempotent), `transactionRequestAction` (CHARGE/REFUND/CANCEL via manual or Stripe PSP)
- [x] `paymentCapture/Refund/Void`, `paymentCheckBalance` (honest unsupported-gateway error), `payment(s)`, `transactions` queries
- [x] `transactionAuthorize/Charge`, `transactionInitialize` (Stripe intent clientSecret / manual {}), `transactionProcess`, `paymentInitialize`
- [x] `transactionCreate` (opening buckets as success events), `transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund`, `storedPaymentMethodRequestDelete` (sync-webhook fan-out; fails to deliver with no vault app)
- [x] Gateway session/tokenization roots (`paymentGatewayInitialize*`, `paymentMethod*Tokenization`): honest not-configured results (no session apps installed)
- [~] Stripe skeleton (mock tests + live routing when app names stripe); Adyen + other gateways missing

## 3. Orders (staff ops core)
- [x] `orderConfirm/Capture/Refund/Void/MarkAsPaid/Update/UpdateShipping/NoteAdd/NoteUpdate/LineUpdate/LinesCreate/LineDelete/DiscountAdd/Update/Delete/LineDiscountUpdate/Remove`
- [x] Fulfillments: `orderFulfill/Approve/Cancel/UpdateTracking/RefundProducts/ReturnProducts`, granted refunds create/update/execute, money columns + statuses refreshed
- [x] Drafts: `draftOrderCreate/Update/Delete/Complete/BulkDelete`, `draftOrders` query, `orderLinesCreate` on drafts
- [x] `orderBulkCreate` (migration import: lines/addresses/discounts/fulfillments/transactions/invoices/notes, ≤50/call)
- [x] Order view depth: fulfillments, transactions, invoices, addresses, channel, notes, charge/authorize statuses
- [x] `checkouts` list query (real rows: channel slug/filter/sort/paginate, staff-gated; dashboard only selects id+created)

## 4. Gift cards
- [x] Full CRUD: create (custom codes ≤16)/update/delete/activate/deactivate/notes/resend/settings/bulk/assign, balance adjust, CSV/XLSX export
- [x] `exportGiftCards` FILTER scope (list predicates: active/code/currency/created-by/used/products/tags/users/balance ranges; metadata ignored like the list) + XLSX (minimal inline-string workbook, verified zip)

## 5. Promotions / vouchers / legacy sales
- [x] Promotions + rules CRUD, bulk delete, channel/gift links, predicate JSON the engine evaluates
- [x] Vouchers CRUD, catalogues add/remove, channel listings, code bulk delete, CSV export
- [x] Legacy `saleCreate/Update/Delete/BulkDelete/CataloguesAdd/Remove/ChannelListingUpdate` (promotion-backed, `Sale` node resolves)
- [x] Translates: promotion/rule/shop + bulk product/variant/attribute/value translates

## 6. Catalog
- [x] Products/variants/categories/collections CRUD + listings, attributes + values, `productBulkCreate` (listings/stocks/attributes, REJECT_EVERYTHING pre-validated), bulk deletes, reorder attributes/values, variant reorder/setDefault/stocksDelete, media CRUD/reorder/assign
- [x] Product types CRUD + `productType(s)`, `productVariant(s)` queries
- [x] `attributeBulkCreate/Update`
- [x] Stock: `stock(s)` reads, `stockBulkUpdate`, zone links, reservations/allocations, sweeper beat
- [x] `fileUpload` (real multipart per graphql-multipart-request-spec: magic-bytes mime check vs Django allowlist + ext match, `file_upload/<name>_<hash><ext>`, served via /media/; RAM-buffered with 20MiB cap `RUSTIFY_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`; cleanup never escapes media root); `ProductMediaCreate.image` Upload live (stored under `products/`). Category/collection `backgroundImage` Upload inputs typecheck but stay accepted-ignored (reads resolve real paths)

## 7. Menus / pages
- [x] Menus/items CRUD + move (MPTT rebuilt), navigation assign, `menu(s)/menuItem(s)` reads
- [x] Pages CRUD/bulk/publish, page types CRUD/attributes/reorder, `page(s)/pageType(s)` reads

## 8. Shipping / warehouses / channels / tax
- [x] Zones/methods CRUD/bulk, exclusions, postal rules, channel listings with money, `orderSettingsUpdate`
- [x] Warehouses CRUD (id/externalReference), channels CRUD/activate/settings/zones/warehouses/reorder, tax classes + country rates CRUD
- [x] `shopFetchTaxRates` (honest no-provider result — deprecated root), `taxCountryConfigurations` query
- [~] Tax providers (AvaTax/TaxJar) + `taxAppId` execution; Click&Collect depth; preorders (deactivate only)

## 9. Accounts
- [x] Staff/customer CRUD, groups, customer types, staff notification recipients (create/delete/update), addresses (staff + own `accountAddressCreate/Update/Delete/SetDefaultAddress`), password/register/confirm/delete flows, throttle, tokens
- [x] `addressValidationRules` (built-in US/CA dataset + generic fallback; EU refused like Django)
- [x] `sendConfirmationEmail` + real SMTP (plain relay, Mailpit default; log-and-continue so mail never breaks flows)
- [x] External auth roots: honest not-configured errors (no external plugin installed)
- [x] `userAvatarUpdate/Delete` (staff-only, image-only, old file + thumbnail rows cleaned; `User.avatar` resolves /media/ URL)

## 10. Apps / webhooks / plugins
- [x] Webhooks CRUD + dryRun (real object payloads) + `webhookTrigger` + `eventDeliveryRetry`, outbox fan-out/attempts/sweeper, `webhookEvents/samplePayload`
- [x] Apps: `app/appInstallations` queries, install (real manifest fetch)/retry/delete-failed, CRUD/activate/tokens/problems, `appTokenVerify`, `appProblemDismiss`, `appReenableSyncWebhooks`
- [x] `pluginUpdate`, `plugin(s)` queries, `externalNotificationTrigger` (outbox fan-out)
- [ ] App OAuth dance details (token exchange callbacks are app-side)

## 11. Invoices / settings / exports
- [x] Invoices: request/send/create/update/delete/request-delete + `invoices` on orders
- [x] Refund/return reason settings + queries, gift-card settings, shop settings translate
- [x] CSV+XLSX exports: products/gift-cards (ALL/IDS/FILTER) + voucher-codes + `exportFiles`/`exportFile` reads, media-served downloads; every job writes ExportEvent rows (started/success/failed)
- [x] `delete_old_export_files` beat (real, Django-verbatim retention: eventless files or any event older than `EXPORT_FILES_TIMEDELTA`/30d go; storage unlinked, events deleted before files)

## 12. Non-GraphQL (each a project)
- [x] SMTP transactional mail (plain relay, no TLS/auth — localhost-relay posture like Django's `EMAIL_HOST`)
- [x] Multipart upload (live 2026-09-25: `fileUpload`, avatars, product media images)
- [ ] 30+ payment gateways (only Stripe skeleton)
- [ ] Tax providers, preorders/C&C depth, Saleor Apps SDK beyond tokens
- [ ] `update*SearchVector` beats (search is pg_trgm — equivalent by design)

## Appendix — audit trail (nothing was deleted, only consolidated)

Every line of the pre-2026-09-24 checklist and where it lives now. The
rewrite merged 90+ lines into 12 sections; this table proves no item was
dropped silently.
